🧍‍♀️ 1. Gender Distribution

> “Palmoria employs 946 people across several regions and departments. Our analysis shows relatively balanced gender representation in some areas, but notable disparities in others.”



By Location:

Lagos has the lowest female representation.

Kaduna shows a relatively more balanced distribution.


By Department:

Certain departments like Engineering and Support have low female counts, suggesting potential recruitment gaps or retention issues.



✅ Action: Consider gender diversity targets in hiring, especially in technical roles and locations like Lagos.


---

📊 2. Performance Ratings by Gender

> “We analyzed how performance ratings vary by gender.”



Males received a higher proportion of 'Very Good' and 'Good' ratings.

Females were more represented in 'Average' and 'Poor' categories.


🔍 This may indicate:

Potential bias in performance evaluations

Or underlying differences in role alignment or development opportunities


✅ Action: Conduct a fairness review of performance evaluation processes, especially across rating categories.


---

💰 3. Salary & Pay Structure

> “Total salary allocation stands at $69.72M, with an additional $2M allocated in bonuses.”



Salary Bands:

A large portion of employees fall within $70K–$100K range.

Only a few are in the $20K–$40K range, suggesting fewer entry-level positions or compliance with high minimums.


By Location:

Lagos and Kaduna average salaries are higher, indicating location-based market alignment.


By Department & Gender:

Across most departments, males earn more than females.

Legal, Engineering, and Business Development show noticeable gender pay gaps.



✅ Action: These departments should be prioritized for deeper pay equity audits.


---

⚠️ 4. Salary Compliance Check

> “With new regulations requiring all manufacturing employees to earn at least $90,000, we assessed compliance.”



🟡 (If applicable) A portion of manufacturing employees fall below this threshold — this needs immediate correction.

✅ Action: Review and adjust manufacturing department salaries to meet regulatory requirements.


---

🎁 5. Bonus Allocation

> “Bonuses have been distributed based on performance ratings, with a total payout of $2M.”



Employees with higher ratings (e.g., 'Very Good') received up to 10% bonuses, aligned with company policy.

Bonus distributions align with performance, but...

Some departments with high performance may still be under-rewarded based on bonus allocation share.


✅ Action: Reassess bonus policy fairness and its alignment with role complexity and contribution.


---

📌 Conclusion: Key Takeaways

Palmoria has strong overall compensation structures, but faces:

Gender imbalance in certain departments and locations

Pay gaps that require intervention in Legal, Engineering, and Business Development

Bonus allocation and performance ratings that might need fairness audits

Regulatory salary compliance checks in Manufacturing



> “This dashboard equips leadership to make targeted, data-driven HR decisions — from equitable pay and fair performance ratings to talent retention and regulatory alignment.”
